What additional properties did you add to your models and why?
What were some of the trade-offs or struggles you faced when implementing the new game logic?
    - Added guesses and ship_location to the Game Model. Originally, I was going to store the whole 5x5 grid in the Game model, but I had difficulties. Only the first row on the grid was being displayed even though all 5 rows were being stored in the model. I kept playing around with it to make it display all 5 rows, but I got multiple errors that I couldn't seem to get rid of. So, I decided to add guesses to the game model and keep track of each guess the player made and regenerate the board every single time. Not really what I wanted, but I was finally able to see the grid after each guess the player made.
    - Add losses, victories, and percentage to the Score Model. Another obstacle I ran into was making the joins between diffrent models and pulling the information that was necessary or putting information in a model. Became a mess! get_user_games and get_game_history were tough for me to make the joins based off the users key.
